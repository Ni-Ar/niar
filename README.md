# My personal `R` package

Here, I collect the R function that I’m created over time. This is not really stable or robust, but it’s easy to use, correct, and useful.

Feedback is welcome. This is my first `R` package.

If interested in giving it a try:

```R
devtools::install_github("Ni-Ar/niar")
```
